# Christini Lab Genetic Algorithm


### Introduction
Christini Lab version of the genetic algorithm originally published by
Kumara Sastry at the Illinois Genetic Algorithms Laboratory (IlliGAL).

This repository is intended to be used as a subtree of a fitting project. Follow
the directions below to add/update the genetic algorithm to your repository.


### Subtree installation:

Enter your local Git project
```sh
cd <PROJECT DIRECTORY>
```

Add remote URL of GA to your local project.
  * **-f** - fetch from remote immediately
  * **GA_remote** - Name of remote, you can change this

```sh
git remote add -f GA_remote https://pbtech-vc.med.cornell.edu/git/christini-lab/
  Genetic_Algorithm.git
```

Add genetic algorithm as a subtree of the project.
  * **--prefix=Genetic_Algorithm/** - prefix denotes the directory you wish to
  put the GA in, you can change this
  * **--squash** - merges all commits into one for cleaner history

```sh
git subtree add --prefix=Genetic_Algorithm/ https://pbtech-vc.med.cornell.edu/
  git/christini-lab/Genetic_Algorithm.git master --squash
```

Commit the changes.
```sh
git commit -m "Added genetic algorithm as subtree."
```


### Updating the Genetic_Algorithm subtree:
Fetch any new changes, then pull changes into subtree directory.
  * **master** - Pulling in master branch changes, you can specify another
  branch if required

```sh
git fetch GA_remote master

git subtree pull --prefix=Genetic_Algorithm/ GA_remote master --squash
```


### Christini Lab modifications:
 * Separated directory structure, which includes examples and documentation
 * Bulk of functions separated out of main function for easier readability and
   development
 * Uses openMP to parallelize evaluations of each individual


### Examples:
 * **sga_nsga** - Original example from IllGAL. Contains 4 different setting files.


### Documentation:
 * **Illigal** - Original report/instructions from IlliGAL.


### Development Notes:

#### Branching:
 * Create new development branch for any unfinished features
 * Features deemed to be necessity will be merged into master branch
 * Optional features will be kept as separate feature branches

#### Code style:
 * Follow 80 column rule
 * No dangling whitespace
 * New code generally follows Google C++ style
