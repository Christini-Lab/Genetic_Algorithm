This repository is intended to be used as a subtree of a fitting project. Follow
the directions below to add/update the genetic algorithm to your repository.

Christini Lab modifications:
  * Separated directory structure, which includes examples and documentation
  * Bulk of functions separated out of main function for easier readability and
    development
  * Uses openMP to parallelize evaluations of each individual

Examples:
  sga_nsga: Original example from IllGAL. Contains 4 different setting files.

Documentation:
  Illigal: Original report/instructions from IlliGAL.

Development Notes:
  Branching:
    * Create new development branch for any unfinished features
    * Features deemed to be necessity will be merged into master branch
    * Optional features will be kept as separate feature branches
  Code style:
    * Follow 80 column rule
    * No dangling whitespace
    * New code generally follows Google C++ style
